# Object detection using two pre-trained network mobilenet-ssd and yolov4. 
Implementation of mobilenet-ssd and yolov4 object detection model in google colab. 
Any object detection dataset with proper annotation can be used. In this case, I have used traffic sign detection dataset. 
The images can be annotated using LabelImg which can be installed in anaconda prompt. 
For training yolov4 model, I am referring the blog which I followed: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/train-a-custom-yolov4-object-detector-using-google-colab-61a659d4868
For training mobilenet-ssd model, I followed this blog: https://towardsdatascience.com/train-an-object-detector-using-tensorflow-2-object-detection-api-in-2021-a4fed450d1b9
